# Evaluation Criteria

- There must be a version control system to evidence the solution made by each student. ✅

- At least 3 commits must be evidenced with the progress of the project. ✅

- The commits must be descriptive, clear, concrete and analyzed by you. ✅

- You must make at least 3 improvements to the application (1 of the 3 improvements must be the use of LocalStorage, the other 2 you have the freedom to choose) ✅

- Get a list of questions (that you can answer instantly) and then discuss them. ✅

# Improvements In The Application

- As requested, one of the improvements was the implementation of LocalStorage to store the users.

- Added a library that automatically creates unique IDs every time a user is created.

- A hook was implemented to handle the values of the forms.

- Implemented a hook to handle the crud actions of the application (create, update and delete).

- Another improvement is that both the containers and the components were kept as clean as possible when it comes to logic. To achieve this, a global state was created so as not to be passing props between all the components and all the functions were made in separate files and they were only imported.
